# Slack Status Updater

This project aims to be a very simple app where the user has the options from their slack dashboard to set periodic/timely updates to their slack status.

Setting slack status and activity is tedious and often times we forget to do so, this app just creates a simple setup to allow users to update their online status as well as status periodically.

If you want to log out after 6:30PM on a saturday, set it so on the app dashboard and the app should handle the rest.
